Chapter 4! It's now or never.

# Dialogue 4A
Id: This is it. The proverbial "gauntlet."
Id: Keep. Moving. Forward.

# Dialogue 4B
Id: Not so bad, is it? You're halfway there!

# Dialogue 4C
Id: In some way, this is what the host goes through... right?

# Dialogue 4D
Id: Trying, failing, trying again...
Id: The only reason we're okay with it is cause we're constructs. The host is actually real!
Id: Such struggle... they ought to feel validated from that alone.

# Dialogue 4E
Id: This is it! It's now or never.

TERMINAL: ... <PEERING>
TERMINAL: You assume the perspective of the host, who is staring down a job offer.
TERMINAL: The pandemic has rippled throughout society, stripping the host of their previous job and social opportunities.
TERMINAL: The host believes it to be their first step to normal life... if only they'd take it.
TERMINAL: What memory would you like to **finally** instill?
    - "Hope."
        + TERMINAL: "Looking at the offer, the host is reminded of the people they could meet, career opportunities, and structure it could provide."
        + TERMINAL: "... But doing that every day?"
        + TERMINAL: "Select a sentiment."
            * "Compassion."
                - "Determination."
            * "Determination."
                - "Compassion."
    - "Compassion."
        + TERMINAL: "Looking at the offer, they feel like they're not meant for it. Like an imposter."
        + TERMINAL: "The host attempts to be compassionate to themselves, but questions if that in of itself is real."
        + TERMINAL: "Select a sentiment."
            * "Hope."
                - "Determination."
            * "Determination."
                - "Hope."
    - "Determination."
        + TERMINAL: "Looking at the offer, the host is reminded of the what they've done in the past."
        + TERMINAL: "They've been through worse--this shouldn't be that bad."
        + TERMINAL: "... But was that really them, back then?"
        + TERMINAL: "Select a sentiment."
            * "Hope."
                - "Compassion."
            * "Compassion."
                - "Hope."
TERMINAL: The host turns the paper over, under, left, and right.
TERMINAL: They feel... anything but hopeful or determined.
TERMINAL: What do you want to do?
    - "Remind them."
        + TERMINAL: "You remind the host that they're not an island."
        + TERMINAL: "You remind them that they're capable by virtue of being born."
        + TERMINAL: "You remind them that you are, in fact, worth time and energy. By being born into this world, you are free to live happily."
TERMINAL: The host eyes the paper one last time.
TERMINAL: Through the orb, you see the field of view pan to a pen, ready to sign on that dotted line.
TERMINAL: For a moment, you feel determined.
