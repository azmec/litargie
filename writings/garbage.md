For Chapter 2's Dialogue, we want to emphasize the fact that the host has lost their way. We want to emphasize *conversation* with the host, not *forcing* or *fighting* it.

Id: "This one is real: the last point was easy, this one not so much."
Id: "Go on, convince the host with their own past."
TERMINAL: "You peer into the point's orb and see the host clung to a corner of their room."
TERMINAL: "Strung on the ground is an assortment of pictures, bills, and a prescription bottle."
TERMINAL: "What memory would you like to remind the host of?"
    - "Pride"
        + TERMINAL: "You remind the host of their past work: the blood, sweat, and tears dumped into their hobby projects."
        + TERMINAL: "Seeing what they're capable of, the host is filled with determination."
    - "Trust"
        + TERMINAL: "Peering closer into the orb, you see a polaroid of the host and what seems to be a significant other."
        + TERMINAL: "You remind the host that they have someone to depend on--someone to trust."
        + TERMINAL: "Picking up the polaroid, the host is overcome with a sense of comfort."
    - "Security"
        + TERMINAL: "You remind the host that while they've gone through this before, it's safer with others."
        + TERMINAL: "You manifest on image of their mother."
        + TERMINAL: "Dialing their mother's phone number, the host is blanketed with a feeling of safety."
Id: Well done. Let's move on.
