#Story

Your host's prospects seem low. They've forgotten what they wake up for: those memorable connections with friends and family. But who could blame them? They've been quarantined for weeks now.

In peril, you wake. Bestowed with a hook and little time, you set to uncover shrouded memories--but not before setting balance to the host's mind.

Control the ego; tame the id; contain the super. Only then can you remind your host of what they lived for.
