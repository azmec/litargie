# LITARGIE Story
## Prompt
> In the midst of COVID-19, and social distancing, it is more important than ever to connect with friends and family, find ways to manage your stress, and take good care of yourself. Make a game that addresses one of these issues.

## Synopsis
The player plays as their Ego, derived from the Freudian concepts of the Id, Ego, and Super-Ego.
> The Id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual desires; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the critical super ego.

You play within the host, attempting to steer the id and super-ego back into check by connecting past memories. Every chapter deals with a particular memory, one that generally reveals something positive of the host and they're friends and family. At each turn, however, the super-ego marks the [negatives] of the host and the id notes the futility of it all, reminding the ego of their real situation: the host is out of a job. 

## Chapters
### Chapter 1: Hook!
The player is presented with a menu: "Control your ego."

They press it; the world reveals to them a white, humanoid mass dropping above a campfire.

They press forward, becoming concious of the world they are with. The hook is presented before them, hovering above. Suddenly, they match its position: they have been bestowed the hook.

The player is taught to interact with the world and hook; they cannot be with the world without it, and the world cannot be with them. 

Upon the final peak, they are met with two empty pillars. A chain is piled before the first, a link left dangling on the second. The player brings the first's chain to the second, lighting both with a surreal, bright light. 

The player's actions confront them in dialogue: "Which memory?" Three options stare back: "The anticipation.", "The guilt.", and "The futility."

#### Branch A: The Anticipation
> You show the id a memory: the overbearing anxiety of a new face. 
> The world recoils. You show the converse; the overwhelming kindness of that face.
> The id ponders...

#### Branch B: The Guilt
> You show the id a memory: the waves of guilt proceeding a failed interaction.
> Even you feel momentary regret for dragging this moment back up--but you show the converse.
> A friend who forgives.
> The id ponders...

#### Branch C: The Futility
> You show the id a memory: the sisyphesian dread of doing it all over again.
> The id is revolted; such rigid repetitions day-in and day-out, suppressing its inner-most desires.
> There's no converse. 
> ...
> But, the id recognizes the routine interactions: a friends who checks in, a family member who visits.
> The id ponders...

#### Conclusion
The id pondered. "Fine. I'm here. Get to me."

### Chapter 2: Reality.
Whether it be following anticipation, guilt, or futility, the second world is revealed: Reality--the reflection thereof, at least. 

The player platforms through the level, encountering difficulties throughout. The super-ego chastises them for their deaths, and the id questions their guidance. 

As the player meets the second, third, or fifth fire, the two extremes reveal more of the host's predicament. 

#### Id Dialogues
1. "For what there is, it's not what I want."
2. "Why should I be led by you again? Even chained here, I can profess my desires."
3. "You can't even lead yourself."
4. "Our host wants what I want; neither of you are up to task."

#### Super-Ego Dialogues
1. "What has the world taught you? You can't even walk on your own two feet."
2. "You can't even meet my standards--and they're on the ground."
3. "You can't balance yourself; how could you balance the id and I!"

#### The Ideal.
Upon reaching the twin, unlit points, the player must link them. They don't have a choice this time: but it's a happy memory.

> You show the id and super-ego a memory. A coin with one side--it's a happy memory. The momentary joy of a friendly interaction; the shared disdain for the daily toils with them. Niether you nor them are satisfied, but you have each other. 
> The id and super-ego ponder.

They pondered. 
"Keep coming."
"Stop. Don't move further. You tighten the binds."

### Chapter 3: Futility.
The world reveals a great chasm, with the player in it. Snow hurls itself from above, reminding the player of just how high they are in the plains. 

They are met with a new mechanic: wind. It troubles them; the super ego notes the player's attempts to go against the currents and pressures the player to be governed by it. The id questions the use of it all at each death.

Soon enough, the player reaches two additional points and connects them. They are met with two choices: "Friends." or "Family."

#### Branch A: Friends

#### Branch B: Family

### Chapter 4: Reality...?
Revealed before the player is a series of abysses, dotted by hooking points. 

### Chapter 5: Restraint.
Chained before the player is the id. It's formlessness contained; the primal drives of the host clouded. Nothing can be done in this situation with the id; the player must release it.

Oops! Dodge random bullets and missiles!

The player has attained the key; the id is released. Nothing stops it but the reins placed by the ego. The player rides upon the id, freed from gravity.

They make one final link: one reminder of [Friends] or [Family].

#### Branch A: Friends 2

#### Branch B: Family 2

### Chapter 6: Until It is Done.
Freed before the player is the super-ego. It's form freed: the critical, oppressive weight of society burdgeoning upon the host. The ego must contain it.

Oops! Shoot em up with hooking tendencies!

The super-ego contained; the id tamed. The ego can now interact with the host.
