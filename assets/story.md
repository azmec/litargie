# LITARGIE Story
## Prompt
> In the midst of COVID-19, and social distancing, it is more important than ever to connect with friends and family, find ways to manage your stress, and take good care of yourself. Make a game that addresses one of these issues.

## Synopsis
The player plays as their Ego, derived from the Freudian concepts of the Id, Ego, and Super-Ego.
> The Id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual desires; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the critical super ego.

You play within the host, attempting to steer the id and super-ego back into check by connecting past memories. Every chapter deals with a particular memory, one that generally reveals something positive of the host and they're friends and family. At each turn, however, the super-ego marks the [negatives] of the host and the id notes the futility of it all, reminding the ego of their real situation: the host is out of a job. 

## Chapters
### Chapter 1: Hook!
The player is presented with a menu: "Control your ego."

They press it; the world reveals to them a white, humanoid mass dropping above a campfire.

They press forward, becoming concious of the world they are with. The hook is presented before them, hovering above. Suddenly, they match its position: they have been bestowed the hook.

The player is taught to interact with the world and hook; they cannot be with the world without it, and the world cannot be with them. 

Upon the final peak, they are met with two empty pillars. A chain is piled before the first, a link left dangling on the second. The player brings the first's chain to the second, lighting both with a surreal, bright light. 

The player's actions confront them in dialogue: "Which memory?" Three options stare back: "The anticipation.", "The guilt.", and "The futility."
