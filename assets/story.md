# LITARGIE Story
## Prompt
> In the midst of COVID-19, and social distancing, it is more important than ever to connect with friends and family, find ways to manage your stress, and take good care of yourself. Make a game that addresses one of these issues.

## Synopsis
The player plays as their Ego, derived from the Freudian concepts of the Id, Ego, and Super-Ego.
> The Id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual desires; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the critical super ego.

You play within the host, attempting to steer the id and super-ego back into check by connecting past memories. Every chapter deals with a particular memory, one that generally reveals something positive of the host and they're friends and family. At each turn, however, the super-ego marks the [negatives] of the host and the id notes the futility of it all, reminding the ego of their real situation: the host is out of a job.
