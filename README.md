# LITARGIE: Control Your Ego.
A game [available on Itch](https://aldats.itch.io/litargie)!

## About :mag_right:
LITARGIE is a 2D, story-based platformer created for the [2021 Games for Change Challenge Competition](http://gamesforchange.org/studentchallenge/) and the chosen theme: [Resiliance through Games](http://gamesforchange.org/studentchallenge/resilience-through-games/). 
> In the midst of COVID-19, and social distancing, it is more important than ever to connect with friends and family, find ways to manage your stress, and take good care of yourself. Make a game that addresses one of these issues.

## What's in Here :floppy_disk:
You'll probably find that this is a Godot Engine project, which you can find [here](https://godotengine.org/). Digging a little further into this code, you'll find a bunch of assets I've made using [BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/) and [Asesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

## How to Fiddle With It :wrench:
If you're looking to mess with this project, download the Godot engine and select the project.godot file with it. To start with, take a look at the player scene and .gd file; you'll find movement and state code here. If you're looking to mess with the meathook, you'll find the scene instanced within the player.

If you're looking to learn something from this project, the only potentially useful portion would be the dialogue series of nodes and scripts. Start in DialogueManager in /src/autoloads.
